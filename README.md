# Intent-Recognition
Intent Recognition and classification with GRU, LSTM stacking, DeepPavlov and BERT models with the help of Tensorflow Keras and DeepPavlov framework.

# Data
Selected data is famously known intent classification dataset named SNIPS which is mostly used for model benchmarking in this specific topic.


Tensorboard viz of the loss and accuracy relationships of train and validation sets: 
BERT achieves 90+ accuracy which is slightly more than the stacked GRU and LSTM model
